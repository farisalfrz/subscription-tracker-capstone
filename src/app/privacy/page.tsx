          This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>[This is a placeholder page. For this capstone project, a full privacy policy is not required. A real policy would detail how user data, such as subscription info stored in localStorage, is handled.]</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this application, all data is stored locally on your device using localStorage and is not transmitted to any server.
